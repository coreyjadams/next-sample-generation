Generating a sample

- Install NEXUS dependencies (geant4, gsl, hdf5)
	- I used spack to do this
- Install nexus (I used cmake)
- Generate events with nexus (I used Krishan's scripts for Tl208 events)
	- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvjmistry/NEWDiffusion/main/config/NEW_MC208_NN.init.mac
	- I generated 10000 events, 130 event_ids were generated (1.3% pass)
- Install IC
	- Ran the stupid conda setup script, tests failed.
	- Installing db files with `git lfs pull`
	- Not all tests passed, but many did
	- The cython code hadn't run because I was getting "install_layout" errors.  Updating setuptools fixed this error.
	- After that, `python setup.py develop` ran the cython code.
- I ran detsim with:
	- `city detsim invisible_cities/config/detsim.conf -i ../sample-generation/NextNew.Tl208.ACTIVE.next.h5 -o ../sample-generation/NextNew.Tl208.ACTIVE.next_detsim.h5`
	- Only took about a minute for 130 events, which is good.
- Next, run rl deconvolution:
	- OK that failed because I missed a bunch of steps in the cities.
	- Going to spin this up into a parsl workflow so that I can reproduce this.
